###### **Research focus**: finding patterns in neural time series through convolutional sparse analysis.{#carlos} 

**Goal**: to discover physiologically meaningful waveforms in multi-day continuous epileptic electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings that can be used to build interpretable features for seizure prediction. 

**Methods**: interpretable machine learning, clustering and sparse coding for time series, supervised learning for neural data
