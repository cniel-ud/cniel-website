*What*: **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing**   
These involve the underlying mathematical analysis, design of statistical models, and software implementation of data and signal processing (filtering and neural networks) as well as optimization routines.

* Finding discrepancies in data sets using [divergences](/research/discrepancies/)
* Selecting representations of data using [informativeness measures](/research/informativeness/)

*Why*: To extract actionable information from complex data, especially to **understand and interface with the brain**

* Identify meaningful features (in space or time) of the evoked neural response using [metric learning](/research/neural_decoding/)
* Find patterns of waveforms in EEGs using [neural signal processing](/research/eegs/)
* Extract information from text and use machine learning to prioritize large collections of articles using [natural language processing and text mining](/research/pico/)
